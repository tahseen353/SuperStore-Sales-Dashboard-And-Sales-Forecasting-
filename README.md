  -Visualize findings using Power BIâ€™s robust visualization capabilities.
# 3. Sales Forecasting
## Objective: Leverage historic data to generate accurate sales forecasts for the next 15 days.
## Methodology:
  -Time Series Analysis: Apply techniques such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Exponential Smoothing.
Validate forecasts against actual sales data.
  -Communicate forecast uncertainty (confidence intervals).
  
# 4. Actionable Insights and Recommendations
## Objective: Share valuable insights that drive strategic decision-making.
## Deliverables:
  -Regular reports highlighting trends, anomalies, and opportunities.
